# Other features that are introduced in Java 9
## 1. JShell
JShell is an interactive command line tool in JDK9. One reason why JShell was proposed for Java 9 
is the lack of a standard interactive environment for the language.JShell is a Read-Evaluate-Print 
Loop (REPL), which evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and 
immediately shows the results. It allows:
- Simple calculations by Java syntax
- Write and compile a complete Java program
- reuse Java functions that are defined previously

In all, it is a fun tool to learn and interact with Java.
